# Transportation_Project
Transportation lab project : Implementation of Prims Algorithm in VBA.


Code written explicitly so no need to use only that particular excel i.e. copy paste code 
from module of excel (or from text file provided VBA_Code_Revised.txt) and paste on other excel 
and set short cut (ctrl + j) to macro named Home_welcome.
Everything required for putting code in a module is described in first few comment lines 
of code.
As it has dynamic programming to create pages as it will required for inputs and you can 
select action as per your wish (like in which format you want to input data and other 
necessary inputs). 
Error handling is done as much as required.
For user friendly, we keep two input format. In “Edge Format” you can set data 
according to edges information and In “Node Format” you can directly place data there.
For nodes input you can choose your own notation in case you are giving input through
“Edge Format” and in “Node Format” node numbering would be done automatically so 
it gives you a choice how you feel comfort in input as per your requirement. 
After data entry you can see result board.
If you want to put result for future reference you can click on download and after 
putting necessary info it will be saved on your required location.
So this was small description of our Code Implementation.
